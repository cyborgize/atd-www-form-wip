bug = bug or security fix
doc = major changes in the documentation
pkg = changes in the structure of the package or in the installation procedure

2011-02-11 1.1.1: [+ui] added renaming option for OCaml types taken
                        from other modules:
                          type foo <ocaml_biniou module="Foo" t="t"> = abstract

2010-12-08 1.1.0: [pkg] requires biniou >= 1.0.0, yojson >= 1.0.0, atd >= 1.0.0
                  [!!!] string_of_ functions generated by atdgen -biniou
                        now take an optional ?len:int argument instead
                        of a mandatory int.
                  [+ui] support for shared and cyclic values with biniou
                  [+ui] support for JSON objects as association lists
                  [+ui] new <ocaml[_biniou|_json] module=...> annotation
                        for predefined and abstract types
                  [+ui] -extend option to define aliases to types defined

                  [+ui] read from stdin if no input file is given
                  [+ui] write anonymous module to stdout with -o -
                  [+ui] source location modifiers -pos-fname and -pos-lnum
                  [opt] solved slow compilation of code produced for

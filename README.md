ATD project
==

ATD stands for Adaptable Type Definitions. It is a syntax for defining
cross-language data types. It is used as input to generate efficient
and type-safe serializers, deserializers and validators. The current target
languages are OCaml and Java.

The following opam packages are provided by the atd project:

* atdgen: executable that generates OCaml code dealing with JSON and
  biniou data formats
* atdj: executable that generates Java code dealing with JSON
* atd: library for parsing atd files used by code generators
